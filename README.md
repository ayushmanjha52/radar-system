# Target-classification-using-radio-frequency

The primary objective of this project is to design, develop, and evaluate a micro-motion analysis radar system capable of detecting and analyzing subtle motions, such as human gestures, breathing, and mechanical vibrations, with high precision. The system aims to integrate both monostatic and bistatic radar configurations to leverage their respective strengths, ensuring robust performance in diverse environments. The Multistatic model is nade on MATLAB.

This project develops advanced signal processing techniques, such as time-frequency analysis and micro-Doppler signature extraction, contributing new methods to the field of signal analysis. The use of machine learning and deep learning for motion classification bridges the gap between traditional radar signal processing and artificial intelligence, creating a new interdisciplinary approach to radar data interpretation. The system's ability to detect micro-motions such as breathing and heartbeats without physical contact provides a valuable tool for non-invasive biomedical applications.
It contributes to the growing field of remote sensing, offering solutions for real-time monitoring in scenarios where traditional sensors may fail, such as in adverse weather conditions.
This project will be enhanced as this is the stepping stone and just a basic prototype with sample dataset of how our idea will work.
